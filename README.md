# Machine-learning
---

This repository contains my solutions to machine learning assignments for the **ITMLA DV.2023.C6T1D0** course.
The work covers **data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation** using Python and popular ML libraries.

---

## Project Structure

* **`ITMLA Q1 DV.2023.C6T1D0.py`**

  * Binary classification model implementation
  * Includes model training, confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy evaluation.

* **`ITMLA Q2 DV.2023.C6T1D0.py`**

  * Supervised learning with feature selection (`nqf`, `age`, `exp_level`)
  * Splits dataset into train/test sets (85/15)
  * Achieves **100% accuracy** on both train and test sets.

* **`ITMLA Q3 DV.2023.C6T1D0.py`**

  * Exploratory analysis and visualization
  * Uses Matplotlib/Seaborn to plot dataset trends and model performance.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization
* **scikit-learn** – model training and evaluation

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ITMLA-ML-Assignments.git
   cd ITMLA-ML-Assignments
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run any notebook/script:

   ```bash
   python "ITMLA Q1 DV.2023.C6T1D0.py"
   ```

---

## Results

* **Q1:** Achieved \~50% accuracy (baseline binary classifier).
* **Q2:** Achieved 100% training and testing accuracy (small dataset, possible overfitting).
* **Q3:** Generated clear visualizations and insights for model performance.

---

## Notes

* Dataset: `Prek_HR_data.csv` (external dataset used in Q2 –included in repo).
* Results may vary if dataset is updated or replaced.
* Focus of the project is **hands-on practice** with ML workflows rather than production deployment.
